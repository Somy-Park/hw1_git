Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We would use git because for it can maintain the history of our        
project code so we could access previous edits if needed. We can
also create our own branch so we don't break the working version. Since
we are doing group projects in this class, git also allows for collaboration
so that others can work on different features of the code and push their work
for others to pull and see. Finally, we can ask others to review our code  
in the form of pull requests so that we create the most efficient and          
maintainable code as possible.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines the histories of the two branches being merged 
and preserves their original commits while rebasing is rewrites the history 
of both by moving commits from one branch on top of another to make a linear 
commit history.
